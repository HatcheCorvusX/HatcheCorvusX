  Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am HatcheCorvus or HatcheCorvusX who gets scripty and hacky for fun! we do not cause damage but we cause entertainement of browsing rare things like admin panels of roblox,
  and view hidden things which are honestly a bit cool when looking at it because you would attempt to manage where on how to search things by coding, and finding cool pages and endpoints!
  though our tiny group have been managing to do something a little damagy but not that bad?! our group is testing out how to create an `Fe Bypass` by Lua on Roblox and its where you bypass
  a security so thats basically what it is, now our group a long amount of months ago hacked into the CoreGui and grabbed every single line of code that got leaked, different camera mappings,
  and also things that would update a clients point of view which could be manipulated to have a way to create scripts to be server-sided, and we found private nodes that can be used to make
  a webserver that would communicate with the client even though you are on the default client! we are also discovering different ways to create a bypass in the future so if you think about
  getting code-ish as well or to test scripts then you could follow this account and try to hit me up a message.
